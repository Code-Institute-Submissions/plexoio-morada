                <summary>What is Blockchain?</summary>
                <p>Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed peer-to-peer network that operates based on consensus.
                    It is typically managed by non-governmental or private organizations, and it provides secure and
                    efficient data management. The technology is designed to eliminate the need for intermediaries and
                    promote transparency, immutability, and trust in transactions.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What are NFTs?</summary>
                <p>NFTs, short for Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital representations of unique items, ideas, art,
                    businesses, or systems that exist on a blockchain. They are one-of-a-kind, traceable, and
                    programmable digital assets that can be bought or sold without the need for intermediaries. The
                    process happens automatically without human intervention, making it more secure and efficient. This
                    is possible due to the decentralized nature of the blockchain technology, eliminating the need for
                    third-party involvement.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What is an utility?</summary>
                <p>In the context of NFTs, utility refers to the functionality or purpose of a specific NFT beyond its
                    inherent value as a unique digital asset. For example, an NFT that represents ownership of a virtual
                    real estate property in a game might have utility in that it grants the owner access to exclusive
                    in-game areas or features. Similarly, an NFT that represents a ticket to a live event might have
                    utility in that it grants the owner access to the event itself.</p>

                <summary>How to use my NFT?</summary>
