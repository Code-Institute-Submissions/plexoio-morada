Morada NFT is a landing page for purchasing functional NFTs offered by a hotel. "Functional" in this context refers to NFTs that hold real value or utility.

Please note that this project is not available for public deployment; it is intended solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Roadmap

- Create main `index.html`, `learn.html`, `marketplace.html`, `contact.html`, `style.css`, and `nft.css` files

- Organize the web app's structure properly

- Add images or Lottie files and related content for better interpretation

- Add structural files and documents to appropriate folders and subfolders

- Layouts

- Accessibility

- Anchor security: `rel` attribute and values

- W3C testing

- Apply learned content more on DOM selectors, semantics, selectors, CSS implementation, measurements, font, colors, etc.

- Responsiveness

- UE/UI high performance


## Actual Features

- Full-stack boilerplate
- Completely runnable
- Semi-responsive design
- Structured comments in code

## FAQ

#### Is the structure already finished?

Once the entire project has been deployed, the structure section may be considered as complete.

#### Are there issues in it?

Once the entire project has been deployed, we will add a note with all passed tests for security, accessibility, quality, and semantics.
