# Development Process of Morada NFT

Morada NFT is a landing page for purchasing functional NFTs offered by a hotel. "Functional" in this context refers to NFTs that hold real value or utility.

Please note that this project is not available for public deployment; it is intended solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

- **Stage 2: Structure** is only for documenting the development process of Morada NFT

## FAQ

#### Is the structure already finished?

Once the entire project has been deployed, the structure section may be considered as complete.

#### Are there issues in it?

Once the entire project has been deployed, we will add a note with all passed tests for security, accessibility, quality, and semantics.

- Rather than relying on Stack Overflow or Google for all my programming queries, I specifically turned to **ChatGPT** to seek clarification on certain code implementations and clear up any lingering doubts.
