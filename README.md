# Development Process of Morada NFT

Morada NFT is a landing page for purchasing functional NFTs offered by a hotel. "Functional" in this context refers to NFTs that hold real value or utility.

Please note that this project is not available for public deployment; **it is intended solely for learning and demonstration purposes**.

- **Stage 6: Structure** is only for documenting the development process of Morada NFT

## What's new?

- General improvements in user experience and interface.

- First Jigsaw W3C testing: all valid, no errors. Badge added to the footer.

- New HTML W3C testing: all valid, no errors.

- Finished contact section and added social media buttons.

- Successfully installed Metamask login using the Web3 JavaScript library.

- Added social media buttons to the `index.html` footer and `contact.html` pages.

- Styled the input elements with a cursor: `pointer`.

Bugs or errors are still expected.


## What's coming?

- Improvements to the user experience of `learn.html`

- Responsiveness

- Accessibility

- Security

- Efficiency (`optimization`)

- Addressing the call-to-action issue (still pending)

I am still building the final code structure. More versions are coming!


## Roadmap

- Create main `index.html`, `learn.html`, `marketplace.html`, `contact.html`, `style.css`, and `nft.css` files

- Organize the web app's structure properly

- Add images or Lottie files and related content for better interpretation

- Add structural files and documents to appropriate folders and subfolders

- Layouts

- Accessibility

- Anchor security: `rel` attribute and values

- W3C testing

- Apply learned content more on DOM selectors, semantics, selectors, CSS implementation, measurements, font, colors, etc.

- Responsiveness

- UE/UI high performance


## Actual Features

- Full-stack boilerplate
- Completely runnable
- Semi-responsive design
- Structured comments in code

## FAQ

#### Is the structure already finished?

Once the entire project has been deployed, the structure section may be considered as complete.

#### Are there issues in it?

Once the entire project has been deployed, we will add a note with all passed tests for security, accessibility, quality, and semantics.
