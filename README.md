- Rather than relying on Stack Overflow or Google for all my programming queries, I specifically turned to **ChatGPT** to seek clarification on certain code implementations and clear up any lingering doubts.
- [codeinstitute.net](https://codeinstitute.net/) for the proper education provided, which knowledge is being applied throughout this project.
- Programminghub where I learned the basics before joining Code Institute.
